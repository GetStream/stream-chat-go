## üìù About Stream

You can sign up for a Stream account at our [Get Started](https://getstream.io/chat/get_started/) page.

You can use this library to access chat API endpoints server-side.

For the client-side integrations (web and mobile) have a look at the JavaScript, iOS and Android SDK libraries ([docs](https://getstream.io/chat/)).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```shell
go get github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-go/v6
```

## ‚ú® Getting started

```go
package main

import (
	"os"

	stream "github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-go/v6"
)

var APIKey = os.Getenv("STREAM_KEY")
var APISecret = os.Getenv("STREAM_SECRET")
var userID = "" // your server user id

func main() {
	// Initialize client
	client, err := stream.NewClient(APIKey, APISecret)
	
	// Or with a specific timeout
	client, err := stream.NewClient(APIKey, APISecret, WithTimeout(3 * time.Second))

	// Or using only environmental variables: (required) STREAM_KEY, (required) STREAM_SECRET,
	// (optional) STREAM_CHAT_TIMEOUT
	client, err := stream.NewClientFromEnvVars()

	// handle error

	// use client methods

	// create channel with users
	users := []string{"id1", "id2", "id3"}
	channel, err := client.CreateChannelWithMembers(ctx, "messaging", "channel-id", userID, users...)

	// use channel methods
	msg, err := channel.SendMessage(ctx, &stream.Message{Text: "hello"}, userID)
}
```
